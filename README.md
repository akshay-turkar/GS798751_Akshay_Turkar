## Project Brief

This assessment project, given by GSnergy, involves creating a data viewer application using React and Ant Design. The application allows users to view, edit, and manage store and SKU data, as well as visualize planning data through charts.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd gsynergy_assesment
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## Challenges Addressed

Throughout the development of this project, I have successfully tackled several challenges, including:

- Implementing optional charts to visualize planning data.
- Adding pagination to tables to enhance performance.
- Incorporating filters and sorting functionalities into tables.
- Utilizing asynchronous functions and robust error handling mechanisms.
- Maintaining clean and readable code.

## Proficiency Demonstrated

This project exemplifies my proficiency in the following areas:

- Creating interactive and dynamic charts using Recharts.
- Enhancing user experience with pagination for better performance.
- Implementing advanced table functionalities such as filtering and sorting.
- Writing asynchronous code with proper error handling.
- CI/CD pipeline integrated
- Adhering to clean coding practices to ensure maintainability and readability.


## Potential Improvements

If I had an additional four hours to work on this project, I would focus on the following improvements:

- **Implement Authentication**: Adding authentication would enhance the security of the application by ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the data.
- **Update XLSX Sheets on Data Changes**: Implementing functionality to update the existing XLSX sheets when data is added, updated, or deleted would allow the application to use these sheets as a form of database, ensuring data persistence.
- **Enhance UI Design**: Improving the user interface would provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience for users, making the application more user-friendly and engaging.

## Feedback

The challenge was very good and challenging, and it was nicely curated. The only thing I noticed was that the "Calculations" sheet in the sample-data.xlsx file contains data for only one store. I'm not sure if this was intended to trick the coder, but I was fully satisfied after finishing the challenge.
